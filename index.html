            <h2>Happy Birthday to My Love!</h2>
            <p>
                Today isn’t just your birthday it’s a reminder of how lucky the world is to have you in it, and how unbelievably grateful I am that I get to call you mine. Every moment with you feels like a gift I never knew I deserved. Your smile, your kindness, your strength, the way you care… it all inspires me every single day.

          I hope this year brings you as much joy, love, and peace as you’ve brought into my life. You deserve every beautiful thing life can offer. Thank you for being you, for loving me, and for making my world brighter just by being in it.
          I love you more than words could ever say today, tomorrow, and always.
            Happy Birthday, My Baby, My Heart. 🎂❤️✨
