            <p>
                Happy Birthday, my love.
Today isn’t just the day you were born it’s the day the world was given someone incredibly precious, someone who would one day become my everything. I feel so lucky, every single day, to wake up knowing I get to love you. Your smile melts my heart, your kindness warms my soul, and the way you care makes me fall for you all over again.

I hope this year wraps you in all the joy, love, and comfort you’ve so effortlessly brought into my life. You deserve the sweetest moments, the gentlest days, and every beautiful thing this world can offer. Thank you for being you—for loving me, inspiring me, and lighting up my life in ways I never thought possible.

I love you more than words could ever capture today, tomorrow, and forever.
Happy Birthday, my heart. 🎂❤️✨
            </p>
